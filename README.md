About
-----

Coma is a minimalistic X11 Window Manager.

It makes my life easier when hacking on my laptop as by default
I will get my 2 frames containing 80 column terminals with a nice
gap and layout.

Read the included manual page for more information.

Building
--------

Coma should build fine on MacOS, Linux and OpenBSD.

OpenBSD:
```
$ make
$ doas make install
```

MacOS:
```
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/share/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Linux (required libbsd):
```
$ env CFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE LDFLAGS=-lbsd make
$ sudo make install
```

Key bindings
------------
All key bindings are changable via the config file (see coma.1).

C-t = prefix

prefix-c     = new xterm

prefix-Space = toggle popup area

prefix-p     = previous window

prefix-n     = next window

prefix-r     = restart Coma

prefix-h     = move to frame to the left of current frame

prefix-l     = move to frame to the right of current frame

prefix-k     = kill client in current frame

prefix-i     = move active client to the frame on the left

prefix-o     = move active client to the frame on the right

prefix-s     = split frame
